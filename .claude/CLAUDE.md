## Spec File Guidelines

When creating a new spec file in the `generations/` directory:

1. Place the spec in the existing project folder (e.g., `generations/codearena/`)
2. Set the `<project_name>` in the spec to match the folder name (e.g., "CodeArena")
3. Follow the XML structure of existing specs (`COMPLETE_SPEC.txt`, `app_spec.txt`)
4. Name the spec file descriptively (e.g., `extension_webview_sidebar_spec.txt`)
